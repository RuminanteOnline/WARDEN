# Why

This was created as the R DICE was designed independently from DICE, as well as to be run with R in mind, and not as an interpret of Excel instructions. As such, there are differences in the current version of RDICE relative to oher internally available DICE tools.

# Differences with other DICE tools

### Time of event vs. time to event

RDICE time is considered from start. This means that when a new event is generated at a given event, the elapsed time from start should be added (*curtime*). For example, if at time 1.5 a new event is created, then that new event will be defined as `modify_event(list(new_evt_name = curtime + 1))`.

### Events removed/repeated in queue vs. events always exist only once

In RDICE, the engine does not constrain the event queue to contain the full event list. Instead, the event queue could contain fewer events than the full event list, or more (in the case of repeated events). Events are removed from the queue as they are processed. The user can always set a new event so that there is always a full list of events in the queue.

### Explicitly declaring QALYs, Costs and Other discounted outputs

RDICE will compute automatically total LYs, total QALYs and total costs. Total QALYs and total costs are computed by by adding up the items identified as QALYs (for QALYs) and costs (for costs). Other outputs that need to be discounted (continuously or instantaneous) must be explicitly declared but will not be aggregated together.
